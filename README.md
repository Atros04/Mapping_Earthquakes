# Live Earthquake Map - Past 7 Days

## Overview
With live updates of earthquake data from the last 7 days, we are able to display where the equakes have happened and where relative to the tectonic plates of our world. You are able to explore the data that we received from the USGS about the magnitude and location of the earthquake. We also display the earthquake in friendly colors from green to red; the former being mild and the latter being more severe. At a magnitude of 5 or more, we highlight those with different colors.
